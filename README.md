REAL FISHING is a 2D networked platformer about real fishing. Fish from the hook to the next hook until you escape the scuba chef.

This is a horror game made over a weekend with [Defold](https://defold.com).

## Play

For Windows we have a bundled app in our releases: https://github.com/maxrchung/REALFISHING/releases/tag/1.0.1

This game cannot be played single player. You must have a server running, then clients can connect to it to play.

You may need to port forward 1666 for the server.
